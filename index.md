## Who is this group for?

The Well Rounded Developer is for developers who want to want to go beyond a single language,
environment or skillset. This is the group for you if you want to learn a how to learn a new
language. If you want to learn how to apply your favorite language to a new area. If you want to
go beyond just writing code and fixing bugs.

## What does this group give you?

Each season we'll focus on a theme with monthly talks for developers of every skill level and
from every background. Talks will cover the skills that round out a developer's toolkit and go
beyond just writing code. 

## How can you help?

To figure out our first season, we'd like to hear from Calgary developers. What topics are you
most excited to learn about? If you've got skills  to share, what would you like to talk about?
